 * Controller acts as a communication medium between the code that the user has created for Karel and Karel itself.
 * The primary function of Controller is to perform all manipulations necessary in order to the user's code to be 
 * understood by Karel. Controller will take a list of code, processes it, and will actually tell Karel to execute
 * a specific instruction. Therefore, Controller is, in a sense, controlling Karel in that it explicitly tells Karel
 * which function to call that corresponds to what the user has instructed.
